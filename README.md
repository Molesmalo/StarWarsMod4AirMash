# StarMash - A Mod for AirMash

Hi! Welcome to StarMash's Home! 

I play as `Bombita` inside this game and StarMash was my little creation as a hobby and a means to learn some new stuff.

**So, What's StarMash?**

StarMash is a Mod for an cool web game called [AirMash](htts://airma.sh). It adds a A LOT of new features to the base game. Here, I'll try to cover most of the more important features, but it will most surely be an incomplete list, because... believe me, there's a lot of stuff!

While originally StarMash was created as a complete new skin for the game, as it evolved, StarMash also became a framework that can load Themes and Extensions to the game.

Extensions can be defined as plugins that other users can create and share, to add new features to the game. Themes are new skins that change the graphics and sounds of the game.

# **Attention, read this first:**

Before I start detailing the features, please read the following:

*NOTE TO MAC USERS:*

- Airmash is pretty heavy for Macs. For some reason, Chrome has a hard time rendering the game in this Operating System, and when using the theme StarMash v.2, it's even hevier. But this can be solved:

- When using the theme StarMash v.2, if you open the MOD SETTINGS window, you can enable/disable some of the new graphics layers. The options that matter for this are under the sections: 
    - Background
    - Asteroid Field Layers
    - Decorative objects

- So, you might want to try enabling/disabling different layers until you feel your device and gaming experience is OK!

*WINDOWS USERS:*

- Windows users should be OK with all the new layeres enabled by default, but if you are using an old PC, you might want to try enabling / disabling layers (read the mac note above, it's the same).

# **HOW TO USE THIS MOD?**

Easy! Just follow these simple steps, and you will be done faster than reading this paragraph!

AirMash does not support modding out of the box right now, so, the easiest way I can think of,  right now, is to download a Chrome extension called [Requestly](https://www.requestly.in/home/)..

This extension lets you change some things done by your browser when you are loading a page. In this case, we will use it to change the files used by the game.

The Steps:

1. Install Requestly in your browser: 
    - [Chrome users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa)
    - [Firefox users](https://www.requestly.in/firefox/builds/requestly-latest.xpi)
    - Once installed, it will show as a blue `r` icon, next to your address bar.
2. Download the configuration file [from this link](https://molesmalo.github.io/StarWarsMod4AirMash/redirect_rules/requestly_rules.txt) to a local folder.
3. Click the `r` button, and the configuration page for Requestly will open.
4. Choose the blue button (Upload), and select the file you downloaded, "requestly_rules.txt".
5. You can now close this tab.
6. Go to [airma.sh](https://airma.sh) and hit `CTRL+F5` ( Mac users: Hold down both `⌘ Cmd`+`⇧ Shift` and press `R`)
7. Enjoy!
